                    A committee was appointed at the Layman’s Jubilee meeting to seek out a location for a Baptist Encampment Gound.  On August 26, 1946, the committee recommended the purchase of 26.21 acres of land on the shores of Lake Brownwood at a price of $6,890.
                    The grounds were dedicated in 1947 with a crowd of about 1500 people attending.
                    Original kitchen facility moved to camp property from Camp Bowie
                    Tabernacle constructed 60’x100’ of native rock, concrete and steel with a seating capacity of 1000 at a cost of $7,300.
                    FBC Comanche built a large BBQ pit near the shore line
                    Men of Downtown Bible Class in Brownwood built a tower just outside the tabernacle and installed a large bell with clapper.
                    Water system was donated and 24 ft. water tower with 200 barrel water tank
                    Bathhouse with shower and restroom facilities and septic tank was installed.
